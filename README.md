# Who We Are

The [Students' Scientific Chapter](http://ceit-ssc.ir) of the [Computer Engineering Department](https://ce.aut.ac.ir) ([on Github](https://github.com/aut-ce)) of [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir) (Tehran Polytechnic), also known as CEIT-SSC, is the student body responsible for organizing extracurricular educational activities for the students of the department, as well as cooperation with the department's management in order to improve the quality of education and the student life in the department.

Members of the Board of Directors of CEIT-SSC are elected by the students of the department in a general election to serve for one-year terms. Throughout the years, CEIT-SSC has organized a number of highly-successful national and international events and has won the title of "Best Scientific Chapter of Tehran Polytechnic" for two consecutive years (2014 & 2015). It has also received numerous other national awards, including the award for Best Innovative Competition, given by Iran's Ministry of Science, Research and Technology in 2014.

CEIT-SSC holds many annual events, some of which provide useful resources to the public. Therefore, to keep everything in order, we've made several separate GitHub organizations for them as you'll see below.


## AUT-ICPC
Formerly known as AUT-ACM-ICPC, AUT-ICPC is a competitive programming contest which is usually held in November and hosts teams from Iran's top universities. 

You can find out more about this contest at http://icpc.aut.ac.ir and its resources are located at [AUT-ICPC](https://github.com/aut-icpc).


## LinuxFest
One of the many useful skills that most CE and CS majors will need throughout their career is experience in working with Linux systems. Since such education is not included within the department's courses, CEIT-SSC holds the Linux Festival with many workshops and seminars. 

You can find out more about LinuxFest at http://linuxfest.aut.ac.ir and its resources are located at [LinuxFest](https://github.com/linuxfestival).


## AAISS
Amirkabir's Summer Summit in Artificial Intelligence consists of advanced talks on various topics in deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision and bioinformatics; plus workshops at levels ranging from elementary to advanced in order to make the event useful for all kinds of students. This event focuses on state-of-the-art researches and it works to exchange ideas and spread the knowledge of artificial intelligence for Persian-speaking enthusiasts from all around the globe.
