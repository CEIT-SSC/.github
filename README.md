# Who We Are

Students’ Scientific Chapter of AmirKabir’s CE department is one of the university's student organizations and its members are elected each year by the vote of the department’s students. SSC’s goal is to organize educational courses and workshops, scientific contests, conferences and talks; it also aims to pave the way for students to find positions within the industry.
SSC was founded 14 years ago, and in the past years it has successfully won “The Best Students’ Scientific Chapter of AmirKabir University of Technology” and “The Best Students’ Scientific Chapter of AmirKabir University Of Technology In Organizing Events” award on a number of occasions.

We hold many annual events and each of them provide useful resources to the public. Therefore, to keep everything in order, we've made several separate GitHub organizations for them as you'll see below.

## AUT-ICPC
Formerly known as AUT-ACM-ICPC, AUT-ICPC is an annual competitive programming contest which is usually held in November and hosts teams from Iran's top universities. 
You can find out more about this contest at (icpc.aut.ac.ir) and its resources are located at [AUT-ICPC](https://github.com/aut-icpc).

## LinuxFest
One of the many useful skills that most CE and CS majors will need throughout their career is experience in working with Linux systems. Since such education is included within the department's courses, SSC annually holds the Linux Festival which also includes many advanced workshops and seminars. 
You can find out more about LinuxFestival at (linuxfest.aut.ac.ir) and its resources are located at [AUT-ICPC](https://github.com/linuxfestival).
